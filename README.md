# Time Series Analysis and Forecast

This is a series of notebooks to support lectures on _Time series analysis and forecast_ for a course I will be giving for [DeepLearning Italia](https://www.deeplearningitalia.com/).

## Install requirements
As usual, it is advisable to create a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.
One can follow [this guide](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/) and the suitable section according to the OS.

Once the virtual environment has been set up, one has to run the following instruction from a command line

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This installs all the packages the code in this repository needs.

## Interact with notebooks

You can use _Binder_, to interact with notebooks and play with the code and the exercises.
